CS302 project 2
What do these results reveal about the relationship between theoretical complexity discussed in class and actual performance?
judah: as for me theoretically quicksort there is a n log n time complexity, but practically, it could go up to n^2 because there is a chance the list is inversely ordered. 
Keaton:

In your opinion, which sorting mode is the best? Justify your conclusion by examining the trade-offs for the chosen mode.
Judah: personally because i understand quick the best i feel that it is the best. as for the merging i feel like combining at the end could have issues later on. but with a pivot and a partition its becomes easier to track where the nodes go. 
Keaton:
a brief summary of each individual group members contributions to the project.
Judah: i did both qsort and quick, as well as set up the scripts for the times with the set amounts of numbers and time them.
